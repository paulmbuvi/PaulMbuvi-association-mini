# PaulMbuvi-association-mini

## 🛒 Objective
To simulate transaction data and uncover hidden patterns using association rule mining with the Apriori algorithm.

## 🧾 Dataset
10 fake transactions with items like Milk, Bread, Beer, Diaper, Eggs, and Coke.

## 🔍 Sample Association Rule
**Rule**: {Milk, Diaper} → {Beer}  
**Confidence**: 0.75

### ✅ Real-World Interpretation:
If a customer buys both Milk and Diapers, they also end up buying Beer 75% of the time.  
This insight can help in promotions or product placement (e.g., place Beer near Milk & Diapers in-store).

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- mlxtend (for Apriori and association_rules)

## 📁 Files
- `association_mining.py`: Script with code
- `README.md`: Explanation and interpretation of results
